Database Benchmark is one of the most powerfull open source tools designed to stress test databases with large data flows. The application performs two main test scenarios:

- Insertion of large amount of randomly generated records with sequential or random keys;
- Read of the inserted records, ordered by their keys.

Database Benchmark is a very powerfull stress test tool. The main parameters that are measured are:

* Insert speed – the speed of insertion of all generated records (with sequential or random keys);
* Read speed – the speed of reading of all inserted records ordered by their key;
* Size – the size of the database after insert and read complete.

Every tested database must be capable of performing this simple test - insert the generated records and read them, ordered by their keys.
